# Highway Roadmap Planner
No additional libraries should be required to run this program

Usage:
```
python highway_roadmap.py
```

The user interface includes two sliders and two buttons. 

The sweep line slider changes the number of sweep lines used in the algorithm and the obstacle slider changes the number of obstacles in the environment. 

The New Map button generates a random new map and solves it while the Solve button is used to allow the user to change the number of sweep lines used and resolve on the same map.
